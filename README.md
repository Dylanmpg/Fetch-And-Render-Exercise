<h1>Fetch And Render Exercise</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an exercise I did in Week 15 of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate In Coding: Full Stack Development With MERN course. In this exercise I have data pulled in from an external source with React. You will see a search bar to search for news about something input and submitted. Below the search bar are links to articles about stock market information or what you input and search for afterward with pagination making more articles available on different pages.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download all files into a folder on your computer. Navigate to the folder in your terminal. Install Node.js in the folder(npm install). Install a http-server(sudo npm install -g http-server). Run the http-server(http-server). Navigate to the server that is listed in your terminal in the Google Chrome browser to see/interact with the project.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Search for articles about something entered into the search bar on the web page.

<h2>Support</h2>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
In the future I hope to add on to this project to showcase my progress as I become a better web developer.
